# Machine Learning for Housing in Sweden: A Complete Guide from Data Collection to Deployment 

The detailed blog can be found here. 

This project provides valuable insights for users looking to understand the housing market in Sweden and serves as a comprehensive guide for anyone interested in the full spectrum of a ML lifecycle, from data collection to deployment.

The project encompasses several critical steps: data collection, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, cloud deployment and CI/CD. 

Before we begin, let's have a look atÂ the [app](https://swedenhomepredict.azurewebsites.net/):

As you can see, the app enables users to input specific parameters and submit them. Upon submission, it generates and displays a predicted property price based on the provided inputs.


To build this application, here was the process:
- Data Collection
- Data Cleaning + Feature Engineering
- Data Migration to Azure MySQL Database
- Integration of Language Model (LLM) with MySQL Database
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model Training
- Local + Cloud Deployment
- Continuous Integration (CI)/ Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline

### To run the app locally 
1) Ensure docker is installed 

2) Build the docker image 
```
docker build -t mlapp:1.0 .
```
3) Run a container 
```
docker run -e FLASK_RUN_HOST=0.0.0.0 -e FLASK_RUN_PORT=5000 -p 5000:5000 mlapp:1.0 
```
